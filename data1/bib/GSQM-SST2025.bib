abstract = {Abstract Understanding how the space-time properties of extreme rainfall evolve in response to temperature changes is essential for assessing water-related hazard risks. However, future sub-daily rainfall fields, which are the primary trigger of flash floods, are not readily available across locations and warming scenarios due to the high computational cost of convection-permitting climate models. As an alternative, we develop a Gamma-based Spatial Quantile Mapping (GSQM) method that uses air temperature as a covariate to morph observed rainfall fields and project an archive of plausible future rainfall fields. When combined with the Stochastic Storm Transposition (SST) method, which estimates rainfall frequency at arbitrary spatial scales using gridded rainfall data, the GSQM-SST framework provides a computationally efficient approach to project future changes in regional rainfall extremes. Using Beijing as a case study, we employ 22Â years of 1-km hourly rainfall and temperature data to demonstrate this approach. First, the observed scalings governing changes in rainfall fields with temperature are identified across various rainfall intensities. These scalings are then used to morph rainfall intensity, spatial extent, and heterogeneity. Finally, future rainfall extremes for 2- to 100-year return levels under several regional warming levels are estimated by integrating the GSQM and SST methods. Results indicate that hourly extreme rainfall events tend to intensify while becoming more spatially concentrated, resulting in a 4\% increase in return levels under 1 \${}^{\circ}\$C warming in Beijing. The GSQM-SST approach provides a flexible and physically informed method to project future sub-daily rainfall extremes, with potential application in regional flood risk assessment.},
